        <h2>Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProjectDS-Mushrooms" target="_blank">Mushroom Edibility Model</a></h2>
        <p>This project is part of my final project for a data science course, where I classified different mushrooms based on their edibility.</p>
        
        <h3>Dataset Source</h3>
        <p>The dataset used is the <strong>Mushroom Classification dataset</strong> from Kaggle, providing a comprehensive description of mushroom characteristics.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Preprocessing Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Value Checks</strong>: Ensured dataset integrity by managing missing values appropriately.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorical Variable Encoding</strong>: Transformed categorical features into numerical values for effective machine learning training.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProyectoDSII_ParteI" target="_blank">Weather Prediction Model</a></h2>
        <p>This project involves an in-depth analysis of a synthetic dataset designed to classify different climate types.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Preprocessing Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Value Handling and Imputation</strong>: Managed missing values to ensure dataset quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorical Variable Encoding</strong>: Converted categorical features for model training compatibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Outlier Removal</strong>: Used the interquartile range (IQR) method to eliminate outliers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
            <li>Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li>
            <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Model Optimization and Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Measured the overall correctness of predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong>: Assessed classification performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Models were compared for optimal weather prediction, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted to improve accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: <a href="https://github.com/AlvarezLI/Project_PublicWorks" target="_blank">Public Works Analysis in Excel</a></h2>
        <p>This project involved an extensive analysis of public works data in Argentina to gain insights into regional infrastructure investments and project status.</p>
        
        <h3>Dataset Source</h3>
        <p>The dataset was sourced from the Investment Map of the Ministry of Public Works of Argentina, detailing public works across provinces and their progress statuses.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Analysis and Preprocessing Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Validation</strong>: Removed errors and validated qualitative and quantitative data to ensure accurate analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Pivot Tables</strong>: Used for dynamic data exploration, facilitating answers to questions about work distribution by type, status, and region.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Segmentation</strong>: Filters were added to allow for real-time segmentation by work type, year, status, and province.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Visualization and Dashboard</h3>
        <p>An interactive visual dashboard was created in Excel with charts and filters, allowing efficient visualization of work distribution and progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Works by Province</strong>: Highlights provinces with the highest infrastructure investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Classification of Works by Status</strong>: Displays work progress (planned, ongoing, completed).</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis by Work Type</strong>: Identifies priority areas in public investment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Visualization in Tableau</h3>
        <p>In Tableau, interactive dashboards were created to provide intuitive, real-time visualization of the data, allowing for a dynamic exploration of investments and project progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Works by Province</strong>: Visual representation of provinces with the most investment in projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Classification of Works by Status</strong>: Visualization of project progress (planned, ongoing, completed).</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis by Work Type</strong>: Identification of priority categories for public investment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Results</h3>
        <p>The analysis provided a comprehensive overview of public works status in Argentina, spotlighting regions with the highest and lowest investments and common project types. This insight is crucial for understanding public investment trends and improving work management strategies.</p>
