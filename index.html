        <h2>Project 3: Public Works Analysis in Excel and Tableau</h2>
        <p>In this project, I performed a thorough analysis of public works data in Argentina to gain insights into the distribution and status of infrastructure investments at the regional level, using both Excel and Tableau to optimize data visualization and analysis.</p>
        
        <h3>Dataset Source</h3>
        <p>The dataset was obtained from the Investment Map of Argentina's Ministry of Public Works, which provides detailed information on public works in various provinces and their progress status.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Analysis and Preprocessing Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Validation</strong>: Errors were removed and values were validated, both qualitative and quantitative, to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Pivot Tables</strong>: Pivot tables in Excel were used to facilitate data exploration and answer key questions such as the number of works by type, status, and geographic location.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Segmentation</strong>: Segmenters were added to allow dynamic data segmentation by categories such as work type, year, execution status, and province.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Visualization and Dashboards</h3>
        <p>To enhance data interpretation, interactive dashboards were created in both Excel and Tableau:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Excel Dashboard</strong>: An interactive dashboard was designed with charts and segmenters to quickly visualize the distribution and status of public works.</li>
            <li><strong>Tableau Dashboard</strong>: An advanced visualization was created to facilitate visual exploration of the data and allow filtering and segmentation of works by various variables of interest.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p>This analysis provided an overview of the state of public works in Argentina, highlighting regions with the most and least investment, as well as the most common types of projects and their progress status.</p>
