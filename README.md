## Project 1: [Mushroom Edibility Model](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProjectDS-Mushrooms)  
This project is part of my final project for a data science course, where I classified different mushrooms based on their edibility.

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is the **Mushroom Classification dataset** from Kaggle, which provides a comprehensive description of mushroom characteristics.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
Various filtering techniques were employed to prepare the data, including:
- **Null Value Checks**: Ensured the integrity of the dataset by handling missing values appropriately.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Transformed categorical features into numerical values for effective machine learning training.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
The following algorithms were applied to predict mushroom edibility:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Project 2: [Weather Prediction Model](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProyectoDSII_ParteI)  
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a synthetic dataset designed to classify different climate types.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
The following techniques were implemented to prepare the data:
- **Null Value Handling and Imputation**: Addressed missing values to maintain dataset quality.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into a format suitable for model training.
- **Outlier Removal**: Applied the interquartile range (IQR) method to eliminate outliers.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
Several classification algorithms were implemented to predict the weather type, including:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

### Model Optimization and Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using key metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**: Measured the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Assessed the performance of the classification models.

Models were compared to identify the best fit for predicting weather types, and **hyperparameter tuning** was performed to enhance results.
