## Project 1: [Mushroom Edibility Model](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProjectDS-Mushrooms)  
This project is part of my final exam for a data science course, where I classified different mushrooms based on their edibility.

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is the **Mushroom Classification dataset** from Kaggle, which provides a comprehensive description of mushroom characteristics.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
Various filtering techniques were employed to prepare the data, including:
- **Null Value Checks**: Ensured the integrity of the dataset by handling missing values appropriately.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Transformed categorical features into numerical values for effective machine learning training.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
The following algorithms were applied to predict mushroom edibility:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Project 2: [Weather Prediction Model](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProyectoDSII_ParteI)  
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a synthetic dataset designed to classify different climate types.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
The following techniques were implemented to prepare the data:
- **Null Value Handling and Imputation**: Addressed missing values to maintain dataset quality.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into a format suitable for model training.
- **Outlier Removal**: Applied the interquartile range (IQR) method to eliminate outliers.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
Several classification algorithms were implemented to predict the weather type, including:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

### Model Optimization and Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using key metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**: Measured the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Assessed the performance of the classification models.

Models were compared to identify the best fit for predicting weather types, and **hyperparameter tuning** was performed to enhance results.

## Project 3: [Public Works Analysis in Excel and Tableau](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/Excel-Tableau_PublicWorks)

In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of public works data in Argentina, aiming to gain insights into the distribution and status of infrastructure investments at a regional level, using both Excel and Tableau for enhanced visualization and data analysis.

### Dataset Source
The dataset was obtained from the Investment Map of the Ministry of Public Works of Argentina, which provides detailed information on public works in various provinces and their status of progress.

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing Techniques
To process and analyze the data, the following techniques were employed:
- **Data Cleaning and Validation**: Errors were removed, and both qualitative and quantitative values were validated to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Pivot Tables**: Pivot tables were used to facilitate data exploration and obtain answers to key questions such as the number of works by type, status, and geographical location.
- **Data Segmentation**: Segmenters were added to allow dynamic segmentation of the data by categories such as type of work, year, execution status, and province.

### Visualization and Dashboard
An interactive visual dashboard was created in Excel and Tableau, enhancing the interpretation of data:
- **Excel Dashboard**: An interactive panel with charts and segmenters that allow for quick visualization of the distribution and status of public works:
  - **Distribution of Works by Province**: Highlights provinces with the highest investment in works.
  - **Classification of Works by Status**: Shows the progress of works (planned, in progress, completed).
  - **Analysis by Type of Work**: Identifies priority categories of works in public investment.
  
- **Tableau Dashboard**: Advanced visualization that allows for visual exploration of data and filtering by different variables of interest:
  - **Interactive Map**: Displays the geographical distribution of works at the provincial level.
  - **Temporal Analysis**: Visualizes the progress of works across different years.
  - **Breakdown by Type and Status of Work**: Facilitates the analysis of the most relevant work categories and their current status.

### Key Results
This analysis provided an overview of the state of public works in Argentina, highlighting regions with the highest and lowest investment, as well as the most common project types and their level of progress. These insights are valuable for understanding investment trends and identifying potential areas for improvement in public works management.

## Project 4: [Popular Festivals in Argentina Analysis](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/PowerBi-CostumbresArg)  
This project focuses on the analysis of events and popular festivals in Argentina through a Power BI report. The goal was to explore event attendance, locations, and themes of each event.

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is a compilation of information on events and popular festivals in Argentina, including details such as the number of attendees, event locations, and themes of the events.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
- **Null Value Control**: Missing values were properly handled to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Categorical features were transformed into numerical values, which is essential for data analysis.

### Visualization and Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to explore different aspects of the events:
- **Attendance**: Includes graphs showing the number of attendees by month, year, and ticket type.
- **Event Information**: A map shows the distribution of events by province.
- **Theme Analysis**: Allows exploration of event themes, showing classification by ticket type and the number of events per theme.

### Key Results
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of participation in popular festivals in Argentina, highlighting trends in attendance, the geographical distribution of events, and predominant themes.

## Project 5: [Spotify Music Data Analysis](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/PowerBI_Spotify)

This project focuses on analyzing data from Spotify songs, aiming to explore musical characteristics and their relation to song popularity.

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023), which provides detailed information about song characteristics such as tempo, valence, energy, and popularity.

### Data Preprocessing Techniques
- **Data Extraction**: The dataset was used to extract relevant song data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations were created to explore the distribution of musical characteristics and their relationship with song popularity.

### Visualization and Analysis
Several visualizations were created to explore different aspects of the songs:
- **Tempo Distribution**: A histogram shows the distribution of song tempos.
- **Energy vs Popularity**: A scatter plot was designed to illustrate the relationship between song energy and popularity.

### Key Results
This analysis provides insights into how musical characteristics influence the popularity of songs on Spotify, highlighting trends across different music genres.
